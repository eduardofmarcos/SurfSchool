# Surf School

A simple website project for a surfing school using some simple HTML and some advanced concepts of CSS3 (kind of :) ).

Unfortunately the project did not worked out for the school and I decided just to finish to push here. There is still some adjusments on queries for the main nav to do.

* I took it off the HTML content because it doesn’t matter anymore...
